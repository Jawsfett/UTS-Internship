# CI/CD

CI/CD is a method used by software development teams to provide automation in the stages of software or app development. This concept is to combine development and operational processes into a single workflow that promotes collaboration between teams.
CI/CD are separated into two methods, continuous integration and continuous delivery.
Continuous integration is basically an automation process for newly developed changes to code that is built, tested and merged into the teams shared repository. Continuous delivery is whenever new changes are made to apps it will be automatically bug tested and uploaded to the repository, once that happens it can then be pushed to customers at any moment.

CI/CD is simply a concept and in order to use it developers must use tools that are designed for this method of app/software development. There are many tools specifically tailored just for CI/CD, some of these tools are as listed: Jenkins, Circle CI, GitLab, TeamCity and Bamboo. Tools such as these are what help dev teams give the ability to automate the development, deployment and testing of their apps which in hand solves problems such as communication between dev and business teams and finds a way to send out software as quickly and effectively as possible.
